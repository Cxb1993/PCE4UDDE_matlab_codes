# Orthogonal Polynomials and Approximation Theory

In this folder, you can find the codes that are used in the third chapter of the Master thesis: 
*“Orthogonal Polynomials and Approximation Theory”*.
In particular, you can find:

- **figure\_hermiteH** [*script*] plots the first five Physicist Hermite orthogonal polynomials in the interval [-2,2]. The Matlab function **hermiteH** is used, hence to run this script Matlab r2014b is needed at least. *Figure 3.2 was realized using this script.*

- **figure\_hermiteHe** [*script*] plots the first five Probabilistic Hermite orthogonal polynomials in the interval [-2,2], highlighting their zeros. Running this script requires that the functions **hermite** and **GaussHermite** are in the same folder. *Figure 3.3 was realized using this script.*

- **figure\_laguerre** [*script*] plots the first five Laguerre orthogonal polynomials in the interval [0,5], highlighting their zeros. Running this script requires that the functions **laguerre** and **GaussLaguerre** are in the same folder. *Figure 3.6 was realized using this script.*

- **figure\_legendre** [*script*] plots the first five Legendre orthogonal polynomials in the interval [-1,1], highlighting their zeros. Running this script requires that the functions **legendre** and **GaussLagendre** are in the same folder. *Figure 3.4 was realized using this script.*

- **figure\_legendre\_sh** [*script*] plots the first five shifted Legendre orthogonal polynomials in the interval [0,1], highlighting their zeros. Running this script requires that the functions **legendre_sh** and **GaussLagendre_sh** are in the same folder. *Figure 3.5 was realized using this script.*

- **figure\_pochhammer\_symbol** [*script*] plots the first seven  Pochhammer functions in the interval [-4,4]. The Matlab function **pochhammer** is used, hence to run this script Matlab r2014b is needed at least. *Figure 3.1 was realized using this script.*

- **GaussHermite** [*function*] evaluates the nodes and associated weights for the Gauss Hermite Quadrature Rule. It requires in input the number n of nodes that the users want with the associated weights.  n is the degree of the probabilistic Hermite polynomial and its zeros are the corresponding nodes. It is possible to specify also the value of the sum of all the weights (for default this value is set equal to 1).

- **GaussLaguerre** [*function*] evaluates the nodes and associated weights for the Gauss Laguerre Quadrature Rule. It requires in input the number n of nodes that the users want with the associated weights.  n is the degree of the Laguerre polynomial and its zeros are the corresponding nodes. It is possible to specify also the value of the sum of all the weights (for default this value is set equal to 1).

- **GaussLegendre\_changeinterval** [*function*] translates the nodes x generated by the function **GaussLegendre** in a opportune interval [a,b]. The weights associated to the translated nodes are the usual weight of the function **GaussLegendre** multiplied for the second output of this function. In any case it is not required any extra function to run this function. *Please refer to equation (3.59)* 

- **GaussLegendre** [*function*] evaluates the nodes and associated weights for the Gauss Legendre Quadrature Rule. It requires in input the number n of nodes that the users want with the associated weights.  n is the degree of the Legendre polynomial and its zeros are the corresponding nodes. It is possible to specify also the value of the sum of all the weights (for default this value is set equal to 1).

- **GaussLegendre\_sh** [*function*] evaluates the nodes and associated weights for the Gauss shifted Legendre Quadrature Rule. It requires in input the number n of nodes that the users want with the associated weights.  n is the degree of the shifted Legendre polynomial and its zeros are the corresponding nodes. It is possible to specify also the value of the sum of all the weights (for default this value is set equal to 1). This function merges efficiently the function **GaussLegendre** and **GaussLegendre\_changeinterval**, in any case it is not required any extra function to run this function.

- **hermite** [*function*] computes the probabilistic Hermite polynomials of degree n. x is the  optional values where we want to evaluate the Hermite polynomial of degree n. x can be a vector or a single value.

- **laguerre** [*function*] computes the Laguerre polynomials of degree n. x is the  optional values where we want to evaluate the Laguerre polynomial of degree n. x can be a vector or a single value.

- **legendre** [*function*] computes the Legendre polynomials of degree n. x is the  optional values where we want to evaluate the Legendre polynomial of degree n. x can be a vector or a single value.

- **legendre\_sh** [*function*] computes the shifted Legendre polynomials of degree n. x is the  optional values where we want to evaluate the shifted Legendre polynomial of degree n. x can be a vector or a single value.

The development of the algorithms for the calculation of orthogonal polynomials is based on the efficient algorithm of Avan Suinesiaputra and Fadillah Z Tala
