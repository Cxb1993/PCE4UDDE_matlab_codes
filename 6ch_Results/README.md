# Computational Results

In this folder, you can find the codes that are used in the sixth chapter of the Master thesis: 
*“Computational Results and Conclusions”*.

**IN ORDER TO USE THESE ALGORITHMS YOU NEED THE MATLAB CODE eigAM devoleped by Breda, Maset and Vermiglio** [Stability of Linear Delay Differential Equations](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-2107-2)

-**StochasticCollocation** [*function*] approximates the spectral abscissa of an UDDE through the non intrusive methods: Stochastic Collocation with sparse or tensor grids, and Monte Carlo Methods.

-**test\_1\_Hayes** 1st example studied

-**test\_2\_Cushing** 2nd example studied

-**test\_3\_Hayes** 3rd example studied

-**test\_4\_UDDE** 4th example studied

-**test\_glucose\_insuline** Biological model studied, it uses the parameters contained in **PCE\_parameters\_IGTT**.

In these folders, there are also the Matlab codes
-**sparseQUAD**
-**tensorQUAD**
Described in [4ch_PCE](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/4ch_PCE).
