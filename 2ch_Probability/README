In this folder you can find the codes that are used in the second chapter of the Master thesis: 
“Basic Concepts of Probability Theory”.
In particular you can find:

-	Density_estimators[script] compares the estimates of the probability density function of a standard normal distribution. 
It compares the histogram estimator and kernel density estimator with respect to the real probability density funtion of the normal distribution.

-	Distribution_Exponential[script] plots the probability density functions and the cumulative density functions of the exponential distributions with rate 2, 1, and 0.5.

-	Distribution_Normal[script] plots the probability density functions and the cumulative density functions of the normal distributions with different mean mu and standard deviation sigma, i.e. (mu,sigma)={(-2,0.2); (0,1); (0,2); (-2,0.5)}

-	Distribution_Uniform[script] plots the probability density function and the cumulative density function of an arbitrary uniform distribution, U(a,b).

-	Inversion_method_figure[script] Representaion of how the inversion methods works. In particular, the figure representes the inverse cumulative density function of a normal distribution highlighting its codomain [0,1] and a generic sample of a uniform distribution, denoted with u, that through the inversion method is sent to a sample of the normal distribution in this specific case, the obtained sample is denoted with x.

-	LCG[function]

-	Sampling_Exponential[script]

-	Sampling_Normal[script]

-	Sampling_Uniform[script]
