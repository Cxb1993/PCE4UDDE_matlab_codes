# PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes

In this repository, all the Matlab codes, used for developing my Master Thesis: "Polynomial Chaos Theory: Application to the stability of Uncertain Delay Differential Equations", are collected. 
The thesis furnishes all the theoretical basis and the motivations for implementing the codes that you find in this folder. Moreover the notation used to develop the code is taken by the thesis.

If you do not possess the Thesis and you want to see it please send an email to fenzi.luca@gmail.com. I am very glad to share this document with the interested people. In this folder you can find only the Hard Cover of the thesis.

For simplicity, the codes are divided in folders following the chapter of the thesis:

2 - Basic Concepts of Probability Theory              (2ch_Probability)

3 - Orthogonal Polynomials and Approximation Theory   (3ch_Approximation)

4 - Polynomial Chaos Theory                           (4ch_PCE)

5 - Uncertain Delay Differential Equation             (5ch_UDDE)

6 - Computational Results                             (6ch_Results)

In every folder, you find an other README file whith a short explaination of the codes of the folder. 

The codes are implemented in MATLAB r2015a, and they are extensively used to develop all the figures and the tables of my thesis. In particular, the figures and the table was inserted in tex using the Matlab function matlab2tikz and matrix2latex.

All the attendants are kindly invited and encouraged to report on possible (and inevitable) mistakes and improvements of the present codes. I appreciate every contribution and collaboration; feel free to write me.
