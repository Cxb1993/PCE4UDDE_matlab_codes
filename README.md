# PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes
In this repository, all the Matlab codes, used for developing my Master Thesis: "Polynomial Chaos Theory: Application to the stability of Uncertain Delay Differential Equations", are collected. 
For semplicity the codes are divided following the chapter of the thesis:
2 - Basic Concepts of Probability Theory              (2ch_Probability)
3 - Orthogonal Polynomials and Approximation Theory   (3ch_Approximation)
4 - Polynomial Chaos Theory                           (4ch_PCE)
5 - Uncertain Delay Differential Equation             (5ch_UDDE)
6 - Computational Results                             (6ch_Results)
